🛡️ Zero Trust Security Lab with Microsoft 365 (E3/E5)

📌 Overview
This project is a hands-on Zero Trust home lab I built to demonstrate enterprise-grade security using Microsoft 365, Entra ID, Intune, Defender, and Purview.
The lab is based on Microsoft’s Zero Trust principles:

✅ Verify Explicitly
✅ Use Least Privilege Access
✅ Assume Breach

I designed, configured, and tested each of the six Zero Trust pillars:
1.Identity – Conditional Access, MFA, risk-based sign-ins
2.Devices – Intune compliance, autopilot enrollment
3.Applications – Secure access & SSO integrations
4.Data – Purview DLP, sensitivity labels
5.Infrastructure – Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Sentinel
6.Network – Geo-blocking & access restrictions

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world enterprise environment and strengthen my skills in cloud security administration.
